# 📡 IoT Environmental Monitoring System for Vaccine Cold-Chain Preservation

This project is an **IoT-based environmental monitoring system** designed to ensure the correct preservation of vaccines by continuously measuring **temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, air quality (PM), TVOC, and CO₂ levels** in real time.

The system was developed as a **functional prototype** focused on **vaccine cold-chain monitoring**, addressing one of the most critical challenges in the pharmaceutical logistics industry: preventing losses caused by failures in environmental control during storage and transportation.

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Failures in cold-chain logistics are a major cause of vaccine waste worldwide. Studies estimate that up to **30% of vaccines are lost** due to improper temperature control, directly impacting public health and increasing operational costs.

This project aims to provide a **cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-use monitoring solution** for small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies, enabling real-time supervision, historical tracking, and alerting when environmental conditions exceed safe thresholds.
