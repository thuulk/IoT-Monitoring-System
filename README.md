# 📡 IoT Environmental Monitoring System

This project is an **IoT-based monitoring system** designed to measure and track **temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality (TVOC/CO₂)** in real time. The collected data is transmitted to a centralized database and visualized through a web platform, enabling remote monitoring and alerting.

The system was originally developed to support **vaccine cold-chain preservation**, ensuring that environmental conditions remain within safe limits during storage and transportation.
